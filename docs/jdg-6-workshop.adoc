# JBoss JDG 6.0 Workshop


Infinispan:: _Infinispan is a distributed in-memory key/value data store and can be used both as an embedded Java library and as a language-independent service accessed remotely over a variety of protocols (HotRod, REST, Memcached and WebSockets)_ 


== JDG API

**Note:** JDG API does not have a direct Infinisan community version and it has as a basis Infinispn 6 but with several patches from version 7 on top.


### CacheManager
image:images/CacheManagerAPIHierarchy.png["Cache Manager",height=128]

A CacheManager is the primary mechanism for retrieving a Cache instance, and is often used as a starting point to using the Cache. CacheManagers are heavyweight objects, and we foresee no more than one CacheManager being used per JVM (unless specific configuration requirements require more than one; but either way, this would be a minimal and finite number of instances). Once constructed, CacheManagers should be made available to any component that requires a Cache, via JNDI or via some other mechanism such as an IoC container.

https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/BasicCacheContainer.html[BasicCacheContainer Interface]::

* extended by https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/CacheContainer.html[CacheContainer Interface]
* extended by https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html[EmbeddedCacheManager Interface] All implementations of _EmbeddedCacheManager_ are a CacheManager that runs in the same JVM as the client.

https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/DefaultCacheManager.html[DefaultCacheManager]:: It implements the _EmbeddedCacheManager_. It is used for access of JDG _Caches_ in **Library(Embedded) Mode** and its constructors can take in a Configuration or a path or URL to a configuration XML file. _Lifecycle_ - CacheManagers have a lifecycle (it implements link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/Lifecycle.html[Lifecycle]) and the default constructors also call _DefaultCacheManager.start()_. When the system shuts down, it should call _DefaultCacheManager.stop()_ on the CacheManager to also ensure all caches within its scope are properly stopped as well.

https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/RemoteCacheManager.html[RemoteCacheManager]:: Is used to gain access to _RemoteCache_, the _RemoteCacheManager_ must be started first: beside other things, this instantiates connections to Hot Rod server(s). Starting the _RemoteCacheManager_ can be done either at creation by passing _start==true_ to constructor or by using a constructor that does that for you; or after construction by calling _RemoteCacheManager.start()_. This is an "expensive" object, as it manages a set of persistent TCP connections to the Hot Rod servers. It is recommended to only have one instance of this per JVM, and to cache it between calls to the server (i.e. remoteCache operations). _RemoteCacheManager.stop()_ needs to be called explicitly in order to release all the resources (e.g. threads, TCP connections).

**Library Mode**
With link:http://infinispan.org/docs/7.2.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_server_modules[Infinispan in Library (Embedded) mode] _CacheManager_ libraries co-exist with the user application in the same JVM whilst also application and cache data  share the JVM space. There are http://infinispan.org/docs/7.2.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_why_use_embedded_mode[reasons for and against] using this P2P mode but mainly it offers quick change over another technology, transactions whilst giving away flexibility of linear extensibility.

**Client-Server Mode**
With link:http://infinispan.org/docs/7.2.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_server_modules[Infinispan in Client-Server mode] the _CacheManager_ configuration is provided from a Server with HotRod, REST and MemCache as the current server implementations. Focusing on HotRod specific configurations to reach a remote _CacheManager_ is performed by passing standard HotRod client properties via properties parameter. The remote servers referenced must be running and able to receive the request. If not specified the default address and port will be used (127.0.0.1:11222).  


### Cache

link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/[Cache]:: Is the central interface of Infinispan. It is based on the following hierarchy (ConcurrentMap is not shown) of interfaces and as with _CacheManger_ there are 2 types of Cache Interfaces (_Remote_, _Embedded_) which extend the _BasicCache_
image:images/CacheAPIHIerarchy.png["Cache Interfaces",height=128]

* link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/AsyncCache.html[AsyncCache]: Supports asynchronous variants of the various put/get/remove/clear/replace/putAll methods whilst the net result is behavior similar to synchronous RPC calls in that at the end, you have guarantees that all calls completed successfully, but you have the added benefit that calls could happen in parallel (Note that these methods only really make sense if you are using a clustered cache)
link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/BasicCache.html[BasicCache]: The BasicCache extends ConcurrentMap and implements all methods accordingly, although methods like Map.keySet(), Map.values() and Map.entrySet() are expensive (prohibitively so when using a distributed cache) and frequent use of these methods is not recommended. Other methods such as Map.size() provide an approximation-only, and should not be relied on for an accurate picture as to the size of the entire, distributed cache. Remote nodes are not queried and in-fly transactions are not taken into account, even if Map.size() is invoked from within such a transaction.

* link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/[Cache]: Is the central interface of Infinispan and also the Interface used when JDG is utilized alongside an applicaition (in **Library(Embedded) Mode**). A Cache provides a highly concurrent, optionally distributed data structure with additional features such as:
** JTA transaction compatibility
** Eviction support for evicting entries from memory
** Persisting entries to a CacheLoader, either when they are evicted as an overflow, or all the time, to maintain persistent copies that would withstand server failure or restarts
----
      CacheManager cm = new DefaultCacheManager(); // optionally pass in a default configuration
      Cache c = cm.getCache();
----
* link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/RemoteCache.html[Remote Cache]: Provides remote reference to a Hot Rod server/cluster therefore a JDG Server instance is required. It implements Cache, but given its nature (remote) some operations are not supported. 
** New Operaitons: On the other hand new operations e.g. versioned put operation( besides the operations inherited from Cache) exist in order to optimize/reduce network traffic: .
** Return values: previously existing values for certain Map operations are not returned, null is returned instead. E.g. Map.put(Object, Object) returns the previous value associated to the supplied key. In case of RemoteCache, this returns null.
** Synthetic operations: aggregate operations are being implemented based on other Hot Rod operations. E.g. all the Map.putAll(java.util.Map) is implemented through multiple individual puts. This means that the these operations are not atomic and that they are costly, e.g. as the number of network round-trips is not one, but the size of the added map. All these synthetic operations are documented as such.
** link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/Flag.html[Flags]: It is possible to change the default cache behaviour by using flags on an per invocation basis. E.g.
----
      RemoteCache cache = getRemoteCache();
      Object oldValue = cache.withFlags(Flag.FORCE_RETURN_VALUE).put(aKey, aValue);
----

* link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/security/SecureCache.html[SecureCache] TBD

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/6.6/html-single/Developer_Guide/index.html#chap-JSR-107_JCache_API[JCache]::
* JCache Embedded: _CachingProvider.getCacheManager(file_location)_
* JCache Remote:   _CachingProvider.getCacheManager_. In addition, contrary to Library mode, the first time a cache reference is obtained _CacheManager.createCache_ must be used so that the cache may be registered internally. Subsequent queries may be performed via _CacheManager.getCache_.
